       "startIntroPart1":"Oh, wise and mighty Qin Shi Huangdi, the king of Qin and first Emperor of united China. Qin was an ancient Chinese state established in ninth century before Christ. During the early Warring States period, Qin's underdevelopment and decline had resulted in territorial losses to the Wei Kingdom. But then began a time of reformation in the legal, economic and social systems. The aristocracy system was abolished, all slaves granted citizenship rights, and meritocracy was practised in the military. Focus on increasing agricultural output resulted in major population growth, and the possibility of creating a larger army. Qin rose to prominence and emerged as one the dominant superpower among the Seven Warring States. The final advantage they needed to spread their supremacy over all China was a wise king with an unyielding will. You were that unyielding will, and China has been greatful ever since.",
       "startIntroPart2":"The eternal glory of Qin Shi Huang, whose wisdom created countless wonders, many declared impossible, is challenged once more.

Can you build a civilisation that will stand the test of time?",
